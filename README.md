# Software Developer Apprenticeship

This repository contains the work done and outcomes from my 18 month Software Developer Apprenticeship. The apprenticeship took place during my role as a Software Engineer at Altran UK (acquired by Capgemini Engineering in 2021) between March 2020 and August 2021. 

I passed the apprenticeship by satisfying all assessment gates and demonstrating my ability in key software skills.
 

## Certificates

I was awarded 2 certificates for passing exams as part of my apprenticeship:

1. [Microsoft Technology Associate Certificate](Microsoft_Technology_Associate_Certificate.pdf) for proving knowledge of Java and fundamental programming concepts - variables, functions, classes, object-oriented, conditionals, looping, scope and type declarations.

2. [Software Development Methodologies](Software_Development_Methodologies_Diploma.pdf) for knowledge of each software development phase - feasibility study, specification, design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance - and demonstrating the workflows and differences of Agile and Waterfall methodologies as well as the different roles in a software team.

## Employer Reference

My colleagues provided backing evidence for the skills I demonstrated in my apprenticeship in the [Employer Reference](employer-reference.pdf). They provided positive feedback for my coding skills, engineering thinking, professionalism, and personal development.

## Portfolio

At the end of my 18 months, I produced a [Portfolio](portfolio.pdf) to demonstrate my contributions on real work projects. This document evidenced all my knowledge, skills and behaviours required to complete the apprenticeship.

It is organised into each project I worked on, and for each project the skills practised on them were documented in detail. This demonstrated the application of my knowledge in real-world environments, and the business benefits my skills contributed to.

- **Machine Learning Test Input Generator**: improving the efficiency and performance of software testing with the use of Machine Learning. I researched and analyzed state-of-the-art technologies, and made a working prototype of a Genetic Algorithm for producing test cases using Python.

- **RBLS Train Safety System**: automatic braking system to stop trains overspeeding. This piece of embedded software was highly safety-critical and I worked with a wide range of industry experts in software security, human factors, rail experts and government agencies. As a Requirements Engineer my role was to discuss the features and required behaviour of the system, and produce clear, concise requirements which would stand up to the safety and rigorous analysis of the team.

- **Database Optimisation**: improve the memory efficiency of a company tool used for storing test cases. I achieved this by implementing an interface to a database, where the data could be stored. This freed up the local memory of the system, and greatly improved efficiency.

- **Test Results Dashboard**: a web-based dashboard for viewing test results in an interactive way. I designed a web-based user interface, and developed it in Java using the Plotly library for Java.

## Synoptic Project

The final part of my apprenticeship was a project to showcase my skills for a given problem. The project synopsis for a web application to store quiz data and I produced a working demonstration in 5 days, along with documents to show my design and test plan.

- **Specification**: based on my analysis of the project outline, I created a specification for the application, which met the customer needs, and included industry best-practices for web apps.

- **Design Plan**: design the User Interface, and outline how users will interact with the website. Wireframes were made for each necessary page.

- **Source Code**: develop a working version of the application. I used Python as my language of choice along with the Flask web-framework module.

- **Test Plan**: automatic and manual testing were used. The test philosophy, methods and results were detailed in this document.

The final project code was saved to GitHub, with a live deployment demonstrating it's success.

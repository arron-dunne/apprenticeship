# Software Developer Apprenticeship

This repository contains the work done and outcomes from my 18 month Software Developer Apprenticeship.
 

### Certificates
----------------

I acheived certificates for passing 2 exams as part of my apprenticeship:
1. [Microsoft Technology Associate Certificate](Microsoft_Technology_Associate_Certificate.pdf) for proving knowledge of Java and fundamental programming concepts including variables, functions, classes, object-oriented, conditionals, looping, scope and type declarations.
2. [Software Development Methodologies](Software_Development_Methodologies_Diploma.pdf) for knowledge of each software development phase (feasibility study, specification, design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance), demonstrating the workflows and differences of Agile and Waterfall methodologies, and how teams collaborate to produce software in functional, operational or matrix organisational structures, and the variious roles within a software team.

### Portfolio
-------------

At the end of my 18 months, I produced a [Portfolio](portfolio.pdf) to demonstrate my contributions on real work projects. This document evidenced all my knowledge, skills and behaviours required to complete the apprenticeship.

It is organised into each project I worked on, and for each project the skills practised on them were documented in detail. This demonstrated the application of my knowledge into real-world enviornments, and the business benefits my skills contributed to.

I worked on 4 projects during the apprenticeship:
- **Machine Learning Test Input Generator**: improving the efficiency and performance of software testing with the use of Machine Learning. State-of-the-art technologies were researched and analysed, and a working prototype of a Genetic Algorithm for producing test cases was made using Python.
- **RBLS Train Safety System**: automatic braking system to stop trains overspeeding. This piece of embedded software was highly safety-critical and I worked with a wide range of industry experts in software security, human factors, rail experts and government agencies. As a Requirements Engineer my role was to discuss the features and required behaviour of the system, and produce clear, concise requirements which would stand up to the safety and rigourous analyis of the team.
- **Database Optimisation**: improve the memory efficiency of a company tool used for storing test cases. I acheived this by implementing an interface to a database, where the data could be stored. This freed up the local memory of the system, and greatly improved efficiency.
- **Test Results Dashboard**: a web-based dashboard for viewing test results in an interactive way. I designed a web-based user interface, and developed it in Java using Plotly library.

### Synoptic Project
--------------------

The final part of my apprenticeship was a End Point Assessment (EPA). I was given a project synopsis for a web application and had to produce a working demonstration in 5 days. There were serveral componets I had to deliver:
- Specification: based on my analysis of the project outline, I created a speciifcaion for the application, which met the customer needs, and included industry best-practices for web apps.
- Design Plan: create the User Interface, and outline how users will interact with the website. Wireframes were made for each necessary page.
- Source Code: develop the appplication. I used Python as my language of choice along with the Flask web-framework module.
- Test Plan: Both automatic and manual testing was used. The test philospphy, methods and restuls were detailed in this document.

The final project code was hosted on GitHub, with a live deployment of the application running to demonstate it's success.
